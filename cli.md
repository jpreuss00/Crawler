Command Line Interface (CLI)
You know what a shell is, right? Ever used tools like mv, cp, rm, mkdir? They are programs, apps, commands .. you name it.

They don't have a graphical interface to click at. They offer something else. You do interact with these tools by using their specific interface!

1.  What do you do when you have no idea of how to use a command?
    --> --help
        How do do find out which software was installed using brew?
        --> brew list
2.  How do you find out which version of a tool is installed?
    --> --version / -version / -v
        Which version of node do you have installed? And npm? And java?
        --> node: v10.16.3 / npm: 6.9.0 / java: java 13.0.2 2020-01-14
3.  Noticed any commonalities? Maybe there are some conventions regarding a CLI and how it's used?
        Which commonalities do you see?
        --> same command works for different softwares
        Copy the azubi-projects folder. Remove the copy afterwards. You will probably use cp and rm for that. What's the difference when using the -v parameter and when not? What does it do?
        --> -v shows every process the command does
